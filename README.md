This is my first The Odin Project project (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/developer-tools)
"Completing" this project I realized the lack of knowledge and experience I have.
I often didn't know what elements and properties to use and found that very frustating.
I ended up inspecting the page a lot but it was mostly for picking the correct colors, font-family and font-size.
Even tho it was frustating, it was still fun and I felt like I learned a lot.
I plan on coming back to fix what I did wrong!
